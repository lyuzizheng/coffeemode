# Progress Log

## 2026-07-31

- Established documentation system: `docs/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/agent/`
- Created specs: 0001 (Next.js migration), 0002 (design system), 0003 (testing/CI)
- Created agent harness: `.agents/`, `AGENTS.md`
- Created implementation slices manifest
- Created CI workflows: application.yml, docs-harness.yml

## 2026-08-06

- Implemented `poi-cache-service` slice on `feat/poi-cache-service`:
  - Worker scaffold (wrangler.toml, tsconfig, vitest) in `poi-service/`
  - 4 endpoints + shared-secret auth (`src/handlers.ts`)
  - KV hot cache (7d TTL) + D1 normalized store + migrations (`src/store.ts`)
  - Google Places (New) client with field masks (`src/google.ts`)
  - Maps share-URL parser incl. short-link redirects (`src/url.ts`)
  - 44 unit tests, mocked D1/KV/fetch — all green, typecheck clean
  - CI workflow `poi-service.yml` (typecheck + unit)
  - Slice status READY → IN-PROGRESS; docs/specs/0001 structure updated
- Wrote `docs/agent/pending-user-actions.md` (owner-only setup checklist)

## 2026-08-06 (afternoon)

- PR #11 merged (poi-cache-service → COMPLETE). Devin review fixes verified:
  text-search field mask (`places.*` prefix), cache-write resilience, duplicate
  fields param, short-link host list — all correct; self-test harness fix included.
- Started `places-proxy` slice (PR #12): `web/lib/places/poi-client.ts` (server-only
  client, token header, no-store, 503 when unconfigured), `web/app/api/places/search`
  + `resolve` route handlers, `web/types/places.ts`, 15 new tests (mocked worker).
- PR #12 merged; Devin review fix verified (path encoding for `0x…:0x…` ids,
  Headers-instance merge, safe error messages, 5s AbortSignal timeout).
  `places-proxy` → COMPLETE. All code side through the POI stack is done;
  remaining work is owner credential/account actions (pending-user-actions.md).
